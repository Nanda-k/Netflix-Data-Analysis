# Netflix-Data-Analysis

## Introduction

We have analyzed Netflix data using Tableau interactive dashboard using Kaggle's Netflix data. This dashboard has various visualizations such as a Treemap of movies/series added to Netflix, top genres in each country, and count of movies/series in each country, etc. 

## Data preprocessing

To visualize the data and create visualizations, data has to be preprocessed. We used python pandas and Alteryx to get a record for each country.
